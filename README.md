## General info
This is my education attempt at writing Python codes to solve probabilistic issues.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.11.2

## Setup
To run this project:
1) install dependencies run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) run main file `python main.py` or using code editor(Pycharm or VS code)

## Issues:

### 1
Suppose a random variable Y represent number of successes in the three math exams, (Y is a binomial random variable with n=3).
A student pass an exam when his/her mark is greater or equal to 50.

##### a) Compute probability of success (p).
##### b) Compute probability of every value of the random variable Y.

### 2
Assume a random variable X that defines the Gender of a student. We define a success when the student is a 'female'.

##### a) Compute the probability of success using the data.
##### b) Write a function that computes the probability of a bernoulli random variable. 
##### c) Plot the distribution of the random variable X.

### 3
Write a function that predicts the student mark given (Gender, Parent education, Test preparation).

#### Input:
##### 1) The historical data as a list of dictionaries.
##### 2) Information of the unseen student as a dictionary.

#### Output:
The predicted mark for that student, (The predicted mark is the mark with the maximum conditional probability).
