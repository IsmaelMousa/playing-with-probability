# Playing with the Probabilities 

This is my first attempt at writing Python codes to solve probabilistic issues.

Here we have these Issues:

# ISSUE 1
Suppose a random variable Y represent number of sucesses in the three math exams, (Y is a binomial random variable with n=3).
A student pass an exam when his/her mark is greater or equal to 50.

## a) Compute probability of success (p).
## b) Compute probability of every value of the random variable Y.

# ISSUE 2
Assume a radom variable X that defines the Gender of a studet. We define a success when the student is a 'female'.

## a) Compute the probability of success using the data.
## b) Write a function that computes the probability of a bernoulli random variable. 
## c) Plot the distribution of the random variable X.

# ISSUE 3

Write a function that predicts the student mark given (Gender, Parent education, Test preperation).

### Input:

## 1) The historical data as a list of dictionaries.
## 2) Information of the unseen student as a dictionary.

### Output:

The predicted mark for that student, (The predicted mark is the mark with the maximum conditional probability).
